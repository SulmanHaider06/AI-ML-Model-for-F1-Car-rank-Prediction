## 🚀 Instructions to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Setup Environment

- Ensure **Python 3.7+** is installed.
- Install required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost plotly ipywidgets joblib
• 	If using Google Colab, run:


2️⃣ Prepare Files
• 	Place the zipped dataset  in the project directory.
• 	Unzip the dataset to create the  folder containing:
- train.csv
- test.csv
- sample_submission.csv

3️⃣ Run the Code
• 	Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script in Jupyter or Google Colab.
• 	Ensure the dataset path is correct:

f1/train.csv
f1/test.csv
f1/sample_submission.csv

• 	Execute the code cells sequentially to perform:
• 	Data loading
• 	Preprocessing
• 	Visualization
• 	Model training
• 	Predictions
• 	For interactive predictions, use the widget interface at the end to input feature values and predict race positions.

4️⃣ View Outputs
• 	Visualizations such as plots and heatmaps will display inline in Jupyter or Colab.
