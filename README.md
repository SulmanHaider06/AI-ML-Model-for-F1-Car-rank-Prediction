# AI-ML-Model-for-F1-Car-rank-Prediction
F1 Car Ranking Prediction Model
·  Tools and Programming Languages: 
Programming Language: Python 3
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, plotly, ipywidgets, joblib
Environment: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (recommended for interactive visualizations and widgets)
Optional Tools: ZipFile for unzipping datasets
·  Instructions to Run the Project: 
1.Setup Environment: 
oEnsure Python 3.7+ is installed.
oInstall required libraries: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost plotly ipywidgets joblib
oIf using Google Colab, run the provided !pip install xgboost plotly ipywidgets command.
2.Prepare Files: 
oPlace the zipped dataset (f1.zip) in the project directory.
oUnzip the dataset to create the f1 folder with train.csv, test.csv, and sample_submission.csv.
3.Run the Code: 
oOpen the Jupyter Notebook or Python script in Jupyter/Colab.
oEnsure the dataset path is correct (f1/train.csv, etc.).
oExecute the code cells sequentially to perform data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and predictions.
oFor interactive predictions, use the widget interface at the end to input feature values and predict race positions.
4.View Outputs: 
oVisualizations (plots, heatmaps, etc.) will display inline in Jupyter/Colab.
oModel performance metrics and predictions will be printed.
oThe interactive widget allows real-time position predictions.
5.Saved Model: 
oThe trained model is saved as best_f1_model.pkl and can be loaded for predictions without retraining.
